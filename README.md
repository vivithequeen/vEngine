## Athena Stuff that i require to have in my readme
### WHAT my project is??
vEngine is a very cool game engine with RayLib and c++
#### WHY i made this??
mostly to see what i could do! it was a lot of fun making all the mechanics super modular and easy to use, and using imgui was fun.
#### How??
a lot of looking at documentation and being sad because c/c++ makes me sad 
#### Strugges??
getting imgui to work initally, but after that it was not that mad. I struggered with understanding polymorphism and pointers
